							<p> It&#x27;s sad to say but I&#x27;ve had more hassle with Windows 10 than any previous (NT based anyway) release. 2000, XP, Vista, and 7 all served me well. 10 has done everything from deleted my files (thanks, October 2018 Update) to DESTROYING my Linux boot loader that was placed on a separate hard drive.. it has no business touching that!

							<p> Although this study might have its value in rural education in this specific setting, I can&#x27;t help but wonder that CAL is only part of the story, and what should be taken away from this story is that tech suplements rural education, rather than that ed-tech is better then human teaching.

							<p> It seems silly to have 1,000 teachers who range from first best to 1,000th best all teaching roughly the same number of students a year. Why not give the top 10 best teachers all the resources they need then let them teach everyone?

							<p> A few years ago the podcast Planet Money prepared a peacock according to a recipe published in 1612. This recipe was meant for really rich Dutch people, and apparently being really rich meant showing of how many spices you could afford on your food. Pretty interesting and funny read&#x2F;listen.

							<p> There&#x27;s a (very expensive) restaurant run by Heston Blumenthal in London that recreates historic British dishes, and gives the dates with each: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dinnerbyheston.co.uk&#x2F;menus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dinnerbyheston.co.uk&#x2F;menus</a> It&#x27;s a nice conceit, and I took my wife there for a big birthday, but unfortunately we were slightly disappointed, apart from the wines and a &quot;14th Century&quot; goats-milk cheesecake, which was out of this world. It&#x27;s not that the food was bad, but it didn&#x27;t quite live up to the prices in our view.

							<p> One thing that surprised me as a latecomer to software development coming from a visual arts background is how much choice of technology and working practices are purely fashion driven. The thing about fashion is that the way if develops is largely arbitrary. Changes in fashion resemble a drunken walk through possible design space with the drunkard receiving regular shoves from &quot;influencers&quot; who are usually trying to sell you something. Occasionally you have a fashion &quot;revival&quot; where someone takes an idea from the past, gives it a new spin, and then sells it back to newcomers as the next big thing.

							<p> &gt; So what have we now? A “mono repo” codebase, because clearly a Git repository per function in your system would be too much, a large deployment descriptor per fine-grained component, which Spring maybe called “Controller” but is now called “Function”, and instead of combining them all on your desktop, you send them off to someone else’s mega-mainframe [AKA &quot;the cloud&quot;]. You deploy, get an error message, and login to CloudWatch to see what actually happened - it’s all batch-driven, just like the bad old days, so progress is slow. At least we’re not having to walk to the printer on every try, but that pretty much sums up the progress of the last half century. Oh, and a “Function” will be able to handle a single request concurrently, so here’s your AWS hosting bill, we needed a lot of instances, I hope you won’t have a heart attack. Yes, we run workloads that your nephew can run on his Raspberry Pi 4, but this is the future of enterprise.

							<p> Coming at this from data &amp; analytics, my hope with serverless is to drive some management focus into the underlying data structures that support our applications. In Enterprise world when software grows the hard thing to do is integrations and data management. Take some of the major offenders in these 2 categories - SAP and Salesforce - the challenge is how to make these systems talk to other systems AND get some meaningful analytics out of them. SAP can&#x27;t even talk to itself sometimes due to incompatible deployments across subsidiaries (this happens a lot when companies do m&amp;a). I don&#x27;t quite like serverless either but there is an area, databases, where it&#x27;s going well and it might push companies to take better care of their data. Having 1 scalable Aurora (Postgres) database in AWS serving multiple microservice applications is a data analytics dream - entities, tables, users would be all automatically integrated by default. Running databases is super hard, so maybe removing friction with serverless can push companies to reconsider the absurdity of spending millions for crap like SAP and Salesforce whose main goal is to lock your data in their systems.

							<p> Many IRC channels have a culture of generosity, strangers assisting each other in real time. More generally, I wonder if this and working on open source projects would be equivalent to helping strangers&#x2F;volunteering in real life.

							<p> I was doing all these things this week, and had a realization that the older I get more and more rely on me. I don&#x27;t know how it got to be that way. But it was probably doing one kind thing followed by another. And now I&#x27;m getting all kinds of help requests. Just in the last week, I helped my cousin move (ridiculous amount of stuff), donated to my other cousins gofund me for his restaurant and stayed up 3 hours talking with him about his problems. Fixed a family friends laptop. The list go on. Its like snowball. I&#x27;m just accumulating connections I guess. So I suppose thats good, but on the other hand I probably spent 2 days last week on just doing things for people. If I reflect on it, I can see how this would improve someones mental health to be kind. You are connecting with people and interacting with them. So you definitely feel less lonely for example.

							<p> The most impressive part to me is how the m1 compares to the 3900X. I’ve got a mere 3600X and every laptop I owned or worked on over the past year is noticeably and painfully slower than the 3600X. It’s been a relief to get home and turn on my desktop. It doesn’t matter if the laptops I’m using are very recent i7’s and i9’s, the desktop is always very noticeably faster.

							<p> With all the discussion about what the “big trick” is that makes the M1 seem to be such a breakthrough, I can’t help but wonder, if the M1 is more like the iPhone: The sum of a large number of small engineering improvements, coupled with a lot of component integration detail work, topped off by some very shrewd supply chain arrangements.

							<p> I think the narrative around instruction set is a bit overblown. I was a chip architect for the shader core at a major GPU company. I worked on simulators and modeling performance for next generation chips where we changed the ISA for each family of chips. The big reason why Apple Silicon is so damn fast is because they were able to shape the design at modeling time exclusively around Mac system level workloads. At best, Intel would have some subset of traces come from Apple for important traces to optimize for. Combine getting to narrow traces down exclusively for one platform, and heterogeneous design space (cpu + coprocessors) and you can really tune a monster.

							<p> Not clear what RISC-V has to do with the Apple M1.

							<p> If you do want something that can look inside a building and determine the positions of people and objects, look up wifi 
slam [0] which was acquired by apple. It can use the wifi signals to map out the inside of a building and determine the location of objects inside.  About a decade later, thanks to neural networks and other techniques, they can use wifi to determine pose information, they can create a rough skeletal model of a person that moves as you move. [1] The 2020 enhancements are a decent upgrade. [2]

							<p> Why does it seem that press releases and public statements like this tend to overstate things, to the point of fallacy, in order to make a definitive point?
